# pythonbot
A python bot for discord.

Requirements:

Python 3.4 or later available at https://www.python.org/
Discord.py available at https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py
	-Note: The instructions state that "python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]" is used in commandline to install discord.py but python3 is a pain to set up. Instead use "py -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]".

To run the bot, in the commandline, navigate to the directory folder for the bot and input "py mybot.py" to activate it. 
	
	
	
Currently Discord voice options are not available but are intended to be implemented.
